# rust-practice
Learning rust for my Summer 2023 research project with CU Capra
In preparation for working with [easy-smt](https://docs.rs/easy-smt/latest/easy_smt/), a rust crate that provides APIs for buildimg SMT expressions and querying a solver for those expressions.

## Goals
* [x] install rust ~6/15/23~
* [x] install rust extension for vscode
* [ ] build and compile a project
* [ ] write a small program in rust 
* [ ] review SMT (satisfiability modulo theories)
* [ ] explore easy-smt, a rust-smt tool
