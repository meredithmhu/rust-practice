# rust-practice
Learning [the rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) for my Summer 2023 research project with [CU Capra](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/)
In preparation for working with [easy-smt](https://docs.rs/easy-smt/latest/easy_smt/), a rust crate that provides APIs for buildimg SMT expressions and querying a solver for those expressions.

## Goals
* [x] install rust ~~6/15/23~~
* [x] install rust extension for vscode ~~6/15/23~~
* [ ] build and compile a project
* [ ] write a small program in rust 
* [ ] review SMT (satisfiability modulo theories)
* [ ] explore easy-smt, a rust-smt tool
